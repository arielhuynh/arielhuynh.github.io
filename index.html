                <p>Now this is a story all about how, I decided to flip my world upside down and I'd like to instroduce you to my page, to show you how Boot Camp saved the day. I was minding my own business at work per usual and just felt complacent with where I was at in life. When I first got my job promotion, it was exciting because I was learning something new and different than what I was normally used to and putting out fires and solving problems. Once I figured it out and there were no problems left to solve, I just didn't know what to do with my days.  </p>
                <p>All throughout school, my favorite class was math because I loved solving problems or that there is always a solution. At work, I had become the person that people went to when they had problems and needed help figuring out solutions. One of the main reasons why I decided to enroll in coding bootcamp is because your whole job is fixing problems. If a code is not working, you need to figure it out.</p>
                <p>I think my one of my weakness is being creative and that is something that this bootcamp is helping me with. If I were to build a whole website start to finish, the hardest part will be coming up with the design itself. When it comes to design and decorating, I am indecisive because I always think that something could be better. </p>
